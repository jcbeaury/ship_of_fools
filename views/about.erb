<h1>Production Notes</h1>
<h2>"How the creative team met."</h2>
<p>
  Our lead actors are also the creative team. They all work together at the Gramercy Park Hotel and one night they were
  inspired to write this wonderful story.
</p>
<h2>"How the project came together."</h2>
<p>
  Producer Patricia Beaury, known in the NY indie film world for getting young talent together and helping them produce
  their projects, was approached by Maggie Fine and the creative team. Mike McGuirk (Director) worked with Patty as an
  Assistant Director and through the the trenches of filmmaking they formed a great working relationship. One night he
  witnessed Patty get pulled over on the Long Island Expressway and talk her way out of a serious speeding ticket.
  He knew from then on that woman could make anything happen and coined the phrase "Patty Magic". Ship of Fools went
  from the creative team wanting to shoot this on their iPhones to bringing on cinematographer and world class
  Steadi-cam operator John Kelley, his Red Epic, his B2Pro friends, Rob Kolodny and his Phantom Miro camera, Nick
  Ramirez our incredible editor, just an amazing collaboration of friends to make this magical short.

<h2>"What was the most challenging aspect of Shooting Ship of Fools?"</h2>
<p>
  (Director Mike McGuirk Answer) When I first read the script I knew there was was going to be some complex shots.
  Ship of Fools is a musically oriented film and to capture all the excitement of becoming a successful musician in the
  70s it called for smooth movements. I love setting up complex establishing shots and sequences. So we used John's
  Steadi-cam to build these elaborate shots. In the first scene we are transported back to 1972. We are located on 6th
  Street in the East Village. Yes, what you see in the film is actually 6th Street and we shut down the entire block to
  get thirteen takes. We needed a great car for the band. This is when "Patty Magic" was able to get ahold an old friend
  who lives on Martha's Vineyard that owns a 1972 Volkswagen Bug and a friend of mine from Cape Cod took the bug on the
  ferry over to the mainland and drove it to New York City. All these elements came together on a beautiful Sunday
  morning and the rest is short film history.
</p>
<h2>"The Music."</h2>
<p>
  Our film was scored by Mike McGuirk's Cousin, Brendan McGuirk, and Tony Perry, son the Aerosmith Guitarist Joe Perry.
  They were able to put together an incredibly exciting score that was recorded at Joe's studio The Boneyard, in
  Duxbury, Massachusetts.
</p>
<h2>"How the creative team got the idea."</h2>
<p>
  Maggie Fine, Mallory Gracenin, Rotimi Paul and Natasha Soto-Albors met working at the Gramercy Park Hotel Terrace. As
  Actor/Writer/Creatives they began to talk about film and what elements making a great film would entail. During a
  lunch break one day, a very fun conversation happened:
</p>

<p>
  "You know how you have images you randomly save on your computer--either because they inspire you, or make you laugh,
  or cry?"
</p>
<p>
  "Of course, I saved a couple last night from a blog I like."
</p>
<p>
  "What if the 4 of us brought 5 images each, random one that speak to us and make a storyboard, link the images
  together, script it, and film it?"
</p>
<p>
  The answer was yes. It sounded fun, creative and all of us were curious to see where it would go. That was the very
  crude beginning of how SHIP OF FOOLS came to be. What we wound up creating is a short film that is an ode to Rock and
  Roll, the 70s, the power of a photograph and New York City. We met week after week, working and building the piece and
  before we knew it, we had a script.
