  <h3>Mike McGuirk</h3>
  <p>
    Mike grew up on the sandbar peninsula of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Mike’s first camera, community theater, and
    hacking a beat-up family desktop computer would be his tools to imagine directing major motion pictures. He would go
    on to study filmmaking at Columbia College Chicago, at Goldsmiths - University of London and in Los Angeles he was
    accepted into the Columbia Producing Intensive. In 2009, he established himself in Brooklyn. At twenty-five he
    became a Director’s Guild of America Assistant Director. Mike recently accepted a position to work on an experimental
    project at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology to reach millions around the world and advance online education
    with major filmmaking technique. Mike is incredibly passionate about filmmaking and innovating the industry using
    new methods of cinematography to tell powerful stories.
